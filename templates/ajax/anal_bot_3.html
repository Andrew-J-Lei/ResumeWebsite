            The first approach was including features in the past thirty days of a particular stock, particularly the open, high, low, close, volume, and sentiment. OHLCV could be downloaded in a convenient dataframe from the yfinance API. Sentiment could be obtained by webscraping DuckDuckGo, and feeding the title and description of the first ten news search results to a natural language processor from the target date. So for this initial approach, each example had 6*30 features. I trained a model with a somewhat generic structure and voila. The difference between the training error and cross validation error was abysmal. I realized that an issue with this approach is that it treated all examples as being equally significant, and as I was including every date in the past three years for each stock. There was going to be a lot of garbage. Okay, so new approach.

            The second approach would use technical analysis indicators for features. Technical analysis indicators are already based off of previous dates, so if they actually worked, I wouldn't have to determine for myself which dates were significant; I could just rely on the indicator's signal. Technical analysts use some combination of indicators to predict a stock's direction. I would leave this up to the ML model. After all, ML models fundamentally find relationships between features and correlate it to the trained output. This theoretically matched.
