            In Zen, there is this idea of removing all that is unecessary. One finds beauty and elegance in simplicity. In the quest for this, one has to question what is truly needed.

            Despite how complicated mathematics, physics, and even computer science may seem at times, there is always this underlying simplicity in its fundamentals. One masters these fundamentals and is able to use them to solve complex and difficult problems.

            This is what makes algorithm efficiency intriguing to me. Algorithms may be complex, but they are all built upon simple steps. And it is always rewarding to boil down a difficult problem to its basics, build it back from the ground up, and realize then all that is necessary. You are left only with what is required - nothing more or less.
