            The main hardware consisted of an op amp circuit, power supply, and an Arduino Nano. Audio signals can be read in through an open AUX cable. If one has an AUX splitter, they can feed audio signals from their phone/computer to two receivers: speakers and the LEDs' circuit. An open AUX cable has three wires: two signal wires and a ground wire. The two signal wires, for left and right stereos, can be safely combined and read as one wire using two diodes. Without the diodes, they will feed back into the audio source from the playback device, creating noise in the speaker.

            Because audio signals aren't very high voltage and we want to preserve its precision, we used an operational amplifier circuit to amplify the signal. The amplified signal can then be fed into the Arduino Nano. The output of the Arduino Nano is then fed into the LEDs, which can interpret its signal to target specific LEDs and tell it which RGB values to take on. The 12V power supply is split to provide power to the Arduino Nano, op amp, and the LEDs.
