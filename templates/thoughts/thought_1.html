           It is necessary to distinguish the two. Quick sidenote: Aldous Huxley describes the differences between the two better than I could hope to, so if you have an hour, you could listen to his talk on it by searching "Aldous Huxley Knowledge and Understanding" on YouTube. Anyways, knowledge could be described as a compressed deduction or description of a topic. Knowledge can be relatively easily trasmitted from teacher to student through language, allowing the student to memorize and hopefully intellectually grasp a particular concept. This is one of many differences it has from understanding. For one, understanding cannot be transmitted in such a method. While a master engineer can explain to a novice engineer all the concepts of physics, reason, design, and refinement that go into a product, it is not within the novice engineer's experience to have as deep a connection to these concepts. They may get what their senior is explaining, and the vast knowledge may help them solve problems rather conveniently. However, they would more have to rely on memory and "logic-ing" out how it ought to work according to the knowledge transmitted.

           Understanding, unlike the concrete deduction from a set point in time that knowledge is, is harder to come to terms with, as humans are usually overrun with and too fixated on their thoughts. It runs deeper, however, and can be likened to a moment-to-moment connection to a concept. In this way, the things one "knows" did not have to be explicitly taught or defined, but they are felt as true. As understanding goes beyond the method of verbal transmission, it has the disadvantage of being unable to be taught and the advantage of being beyond what can be said. A concept often preexists the words describing it, after all.

           By these distinctions, knowledge is like the words that form them, and understanding is what the words are describing.
