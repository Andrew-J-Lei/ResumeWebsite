            When I was trying to find the meaning of life, I used to test my hypotheses through the video game, Super Smash Bros. It's a fighting game (or a children's party game, depending on who you ask). Played at a high level, two opponents would be constantly adapting to each other's habits and adjusting their own approaches to outmaneuver their opponent and win. It is hard to brainlessly win. Anyways I figured that if I were to come across an all-powerful secret to everything, it ought to work for everything. It must work on Smash Bros too then, albeit probably not the best application of some supposedly omniscent secret.

            What works? I should be able to find myself winning more often once I figured this out. As my philosophies for life changed, there were different methods I tried. If intellect (or at least complex calculation) were most powerful, I ought to be able to calculate and outsmart my opponent, having thought out all the different situations I'd end up in and their solutions. This was not very effective. The game moved fast enough that I would spend too long in my head while my character would be getting beaten hard enough to beg for someone else to be in charge of their actions. There was too much calculation without enough action. I would also have to ask myself if dedicating the time I was spending outside of playing the game to it was worth the improvements or if playing Super Smash Bros. was worth time at all. So the idea of intellect solving this somewhat backfired on itself, as a fixation on intellect would ultimately lead to a continuous stream of attempts to outsmart the previous one, while not really leading to anywhere, much less a concrete conclusion.

            Other attempts such as willpower - in other words, force - were also disproved, at least to me. I would still lose and be bitter about it. There came along with this approach a sort of entitlement that because I put more effort into the game, I should be winning. This was delusional, of course, and it lead to my being unable to take losses with grace. This approach also lead me to another issue: when I would win, it would not be fun. While I could triumph in this idea that I beat my opponent and my approach works (temporarily), I would be unfulfilled, leaving myself wondering if I really was the winner.
            <br><br>
            This does not just apply to Smash Bros., of course. After all, this was all in an attempt to find a deeper deduction that applied to life as a whole. Super Smash Bros. was simply the method. So, to me, an abstraction could be made. These hard, concrete approaches to forever solving an issue - they do not exist. By always trying to avoid problems, one creates the problem itself. Life could easily become a chore if it is not enjoyed, but rather seen as a problem to be solved. However, when one finds love for life, they become more intimate with what it it. They take note of its intricacies and have appreciation for them. Somewhere along the way, they achieved what they didn't know they were aiming for and win.

            In other words, Super Smash Bros. is a fun game.
