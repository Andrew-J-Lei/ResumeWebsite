            In Avatar: The Last Airbender, there are four nations - one for each element: water, earth, fire, and air. Some natives of each of these nations have the ability to bend (use) their respective element. One of the characters, Iroh, explains the elements and how the people of the elements' nations relate to them.
            <br><br>
            "Fire is the element of power. The people of the fire nation have desire and will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. <br><
            Earth is the element of substance. The people of the earth kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. <br>
            Air is the elemnet of freedom. The air nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor &#128513; <br>
            Water is the element of change. The people of the water tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything."<br><br>
            A person's bending ability gets stronger the more they embody that element. Of course along with this superior ability, the person's character and behavior is also changed. While the four elements are not able to be wielded like they are in the show, they exist in our world, as do their aspects in people's personalities and characters. While we cannot hope to conjure fire or chuck giant boulders with our bare hands, in some sense, we still act in accordance with one or more of these elements. So while the supernatural part of Avatar is fiction, not all of it is. Iroh continues:<br><br>
            "It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it become rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations, will help you become whole." <br><br>
            The significance of the "Avatar" is that they are the only one that has the ability to bend all four elements. They are born able to bend one and learn to bend the rest throughout their lifetime. In such a way, Avatar is a coming of age story. You watch the avatar, Aang, not only learn to bend the elements, but learn about different cultures, ways of life, and the world. By the end of the show, he is able to "bring balance to the world" by finding balance within himself. He ultimately ends the show's conflict not by winning a bending battle, but by showing his own capacity for peace and balance.
